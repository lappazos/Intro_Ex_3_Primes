Description - ex3:
The exercise has 9 parts - 
converting differnt string inputs to a list
concatanating lists
average calculation
determing if 2 sets of lists are cyclic permutations of each ther
histograming a list
calculate the prime factors of natural numbers
creating the cartesian products of 2 lists
finding pairs of numbers in a list that their sum equa to a specific number

and, questions:
1. cyclic - my code brought back True. the input should be type list,not
string, but i didnt put a validation for this in my code.
as it ran, every time i refered to a specific index, it actually picked a
certain letter in the string - as the strings are actually permutations of
each other, i recieved True

2. histogram - i recieved [0, 1, 1] - the defenition was that in the input,
items in num_list will always be smaller than n, which isnt the case. in
addition, i never put a validation for that. but, the function didnt crash -
actually, it worked preety well considering the situation.
it simply checked for refrences to index numbers in the list, and change these
indexes items in the output is it should have. the "problem" was that the list
contained items bigger than n, but my function just ignored them.

3. prime - again, the input didnt match the EX definitions - but, my function
didnt crash, it brought back [].
Due to n = 0, it simply didnt fit my loop range criteria, my loop wasnt
activated, and the func returned the default output i gave it - [].

4. pairs - again, the input didnt match the EX definitions - items at the list
repeated themselves - that why, my output
[[0, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2], [1, 1]] - contained items equals to each other 

In general, i learned a lottt about loops here - also on technique of using them,
but also on the logic need to be used using them.

Special Comments:
success in creating the functions for cyclic, histogram & prime was a big joy!!
